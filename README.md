# AI-BASED-STUDY-PLANNER-FOR-STUDENT

Case Study: AI-Based Study Planner for Students

The AI-Based Study Planner for Students is a modern intelligent software system designed to help students manage their study schedules efficiently using artificial intelligence.

This system allows:

Personalized study plan generation

Smart subject prioritization

Deadline tracking and reminders

Performance analysis and recommendations

Adaptive timetable adjustments

Administrative features include:

Course and subject management

Study analytics dashboard

AI model monitoring and updates

This system involves multiple stakeholders including students, teachers, administrators, and AI service providers.

SDLC Models Compared
Waterfall Model

A sequential development approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Suitable when requirements are fixed and clearly defined.

Incremental Development Model

The system is developed in multiple increments.
Each increment delivers functional components of the system.
Suitable when requirements evolve gradually.

Spiral Model

A risk-driven model combining iterative development and risk analysis.
Suitable for large-scale and high-risk intelligent systems.

Requirements Engineering Process

Two versions of requirements documents are included:

Initial Requirements (Version 1)

Initial draft

Basic functional and non-functional requirements

Basic AI scheduling logic

Limited performance and scalability specifications

Revised Requirements (Version 2)

Revised after validation and feedback:

Added AI-based adaptive scheduling

Added smart reminders and notifications

Included performance tracking and analytics

Added exam-focused priority mode

Improved scalability and cloud support

Enhanced data privacy and security

This demonstrates requirement evolution and change management.

Branching and Merging Strategy

The following Git strategy was followed:

main branch → Final stable submission

requirements-draft branch → Initial version (v1)

requirements-revision branch → Updated version (v2)

report-development branch → Report writing and comparison sections

Workflow:

Created requirements_v1 in requirements-draft branch.

Merged into main after review.

Created requirements_v2 in requirements-revision branch.

Compared changes and updated documentation.

Final report merged into main branch.

This strategy ensures:

Version control

Traceability

Clear change tracking

Structured development process

Risk and Change Management Considerations

Key risks identified:

Inaccurate AI recommendations

Data privacy concerns

High user load during exam periods

Dependency on cloud AI services

Changing academic requirements

The Spiral Model was found to be most suitable for handling such risks due to its strong focus on iterative risk analysis.

Conclusion

After comparison:

Waterfall is suitable for stable requirements.

Incremental Model is suitable for phased feature delivery.

Spiral Model is most appropriate for large-scale, AI-driven systems like the AI-Based Study Planner due to its risk-driven and iterative approach.
